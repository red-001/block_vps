#    Changes how users from blocked IPs are handled:
#        creation  -  Blocks users from banned IPs from creating accounts
#        kick  -  Kicks any users that connect from a blacklist IP address
#        activation  -  Requires all new users to login at least once from a non-blacklist IP
#        none  -  Do nothing, let other mods handle it
#    Note: "creation" is not recommanded as it blocks other server activity
block_vps_type (User block method) enum activation creation,kick,activation,none

#   List of APIs for checking IP addresses against.
#   Listed in the order of preference.
block_vps_datasources (Data sources) string iphub, iphub_legacy, nastyhosts

#    Contact email, needed by some APIs used as data sources.
block_vps_email (Contact email) string your_email@example.com

#   How long IP lookups are cached in memory (in-seconds).
#   May be overriden by certain datasources.
block_vps_cache_time (Lookup cache time) int 30000

#   How many datasources/APIs should the mod attempt to lookup before aborting.
#   Higher values increase the chance of an IP being looked up even if some of the APIs fail
#   but they also increase server load.
